  </ul>
  <ul class="row3">
    3. Write 3-4 paragraphs.
  </ul>
  <ul class="row3">
    4. Include 2-3 images, each scaled appropriately.
  </ul>
  <ul class="row3">

  </ul>
  <ul class="row4">

  </ol>
  <center class="big row1">
    To turn in, attach a link to the GitHub Pages URL for your site.

    If you already had web design, your site should include 7-8 of the above items and also demonstrate some new learning about HTML and CSS or some other web coding technology. In addition to a GitHub Pages URL, attach a Google Doc with a summary of the new content you learned and how it was applied to your website.
